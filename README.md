## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a complete end-to-end pipeline for dental image classification, leveraging the power of transfer learning with Google's EfficientNetB0 architecture. The system can accurately classify dental conditions into 7 categories:

- **CaS** - Caries (Cavities)
- **CoS** - Crown
- **Gum** - Gum Disease
- **MC** - Missing Crown
- **OC** - Oral Cancer
- **OLP** - Oral Lichen Planus
- **OT** - Others
